The hardest part of this project in terms of understanding is part 3. In terms of effort is part 2, because you have to put in effort to be comfortable dealing with the scapy packet. Once you get familiar with it, the latter part is easier to handle. The online scapy documentation is not as clear, and it took really long time for me to figure out how to properly set up. I would recommend the instructor provide some examples about the scapy packet.
